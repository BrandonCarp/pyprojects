# Description: Create a command-line or simple GUI to-do list app that allows the user to add, remove, and update tasks. This project will help with working with lists and user input.




# Also, list_handler is defined after the function handle_add(), so when Python hits that function, it doesn't yet know what list_handler is.

# ðŸ¤” Here's how you can think about it:
# If you want to store tasks with a simple number as the key (like an auto-incrementing ID), how would you find the next available number?

# Since list_handler is a dictionary, how do you assign a new key-value pair to it?

# How will you let the functions access list_handler if itâ€™s defined outside them?

# Youâ€™re on the right trackâ€”just need to think through how that data flows and how to add to a dictionary the proper way. Wanna try fixing that handle_add() with those hints, or need a little more nudge?
